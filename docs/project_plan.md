# 📘 Project Plan  
**Obesity Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to build an interpretable machine learning model to predict obesity risk levels based on demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, and eating behaviors.  
The project follows a full data science pipeline including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and creation of a public-facing artifact.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a clean, documented dataset.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand lifestyle-obesity patterns.  
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models.  
- Communicate results clearly to technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Deliver a final presentation, a 1-minute pitch, and a public artifact.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Poor data quality | Delays, inaccurate modeling | Document assumptions, clean thoroughly |
| Overfitting | Low generalization | Use cross-validation and tuning |
| Time constraints | Missed milestone | Prioritize core deliverables |
| Unclear insights | Difficult presentation | Focus on key relationships and visuals |

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for EDA and analysis  
- **Streamlit** (or similar) for public artifact  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **VS Code** for development
